# Automated-OMR-validation-System
Using computer vision and Python, I developed a system for automatically evaluating OMR. It has the ability to scan OMR sheets using a camera, find the areas that have been marked, and evaluate them using the provided answer key. This technology will be effective for speedier evaluation of OMR answer sheets because it will reveal the marks in a matter of seconds.
